Minimal configs and folders to start BEM project
================================================

Usage
-----

    › git clone git://github.com/narqo/bem-project-stub.git project
    › cd project
    › npm install
    › bem server

    Navigate to http://localhost:8080/desktop.bundles/index/index.html

This will install localy all project's dependencies from npm and starts local `bem server`
under HTTP port `8080`. So you could navigate to http://localhost:8080/desktop.bundles/index/index.html.

**NOTE:** `bem` should be in your `PATH` environment variable. You could do this by adding this line to your user's
`.profile` config:

    exports PATH=./node_modules/.bin:$PATH
